# AYS UI Test Automation Repository

This repository contains automated UI tests using the Selenium-Cucumber-TestNG framework. The tests are organized into packages for ease of use and maintainability.

## Project Structure

![Framework Flowchart](https://github.com/afet-yonetim-sistemi/ays-fe-ui-automation/blob/main/AYOS_FLOWCHART.jpg?raw=true)


src: This is the source directory where your test-related code and resources are stored.

test: This directory contains all your test-related code and resources.

java: Java source code directory for test classes and utility classes.

feature: This directory holds your Gherkin feature files, where define test scenarios in a human-readable format.

pages: Page Object classes are stored here. Each class represents a web page and contains methods to interact with the elements on that page.

runners: Test runners are stored here. These classes configure and run Cucumber tests.

step_definitions: Step definition classes are placed here. These classes contain the actual code to implement the steps defined in feature files.

utilities: Utility classes that assist in various testing tasks, such as WebDriver management and configuration reading, are stored here.

xml_files: XML files, if any, used in tests can be placed here.

resources: This directory contains non-Java resources needed for tests, such as TestNG configuration files (testng.xml), test data files (TestData.xlsx), and more.

reports: This directory is used to store test reports generated by testing framework or tools.

drivers: It contains web browser driver executables (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver) necessary for browser automation.

pom.xml: This is the Maven project configuration file that specifies dependencies and other project settings.

README.md: A documentation file explaining the project and providing usage instructions.
