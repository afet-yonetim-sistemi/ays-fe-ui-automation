# AYS UI Test Automation Repository

This repository contains automated UI tests using the Selenium-Cucumber-TestNG framework. The tests are organized into packages for ease of use and maintainability.

## Project Structure

![Framework Flowchart](AYS_FLOWCHART.jpg?raw=true)


src: This is the source directory where your test-related code and resources are stored.

test: This directory contains all your test-related code and resources.

java: Java source code directory for test classes and utility classes.

feature: This directory holds your Gherkin feature files, where define test scenarios in a human-readable format.

pages: Page Object classes are stored here. Each class represents a web page and contains methods to interact with the elements on that page.

runners: Test runners are stored here. These classes configure and run Cucumber tests.

step_definitions: Step definition classes are placed here. These classes contain the actual code to implement the steps defined in feature files.

utilities: Utility classes that assist in various testing tasks, such as WebDriver management and configuration reading, are stored here.

xml_files: XML files, if any, used in tests can be placed here.

resources: This directory contains non-Java resources needed for tests, such as TestNG configuration files (testng.xml), test data files (TestData.xlsx), and more.

reports: This directory is used to store test reports generated by testing framework or tools.

drivers: It contains web browser driver executables (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver) necessary for browser automation.

pom.xml: This is the Maven project configuration file that specifies dependencies and other project settings.

README.md: A documentation file explaining the project and providing usage instructions.

## Using the Configuration File

The project leverages a configuration file (configuration.properties) to securely manage sensitive or environment-specific data.

To effectively utilize this configuration file, follow these steps:
1. **Create a Configuration File:** Duplicate the sample_configuration.properties file provided in the framework,
   renaming it as configuration.properties. Input your sensitive data in the form of key-value pairs within this file.
2. **Accessing Configuration Data:** To access the stored data, use the PROPERTIES.getProperty("your key")
   method available under the configuration package. This method retrieves the values associated with specific keys from the
   configuration.properties file.

By following these steps, you can securely manage sensitive information and easily access it within the project using the AysConfigurationProperty class.

## Running Specific Test Suites

You can run specific test suites by modifying the testng.xml file under the testsuite package. Add or remove <suite> elements to define the suites you want to run.

## Generating Reports

Test execution reports can be found in the target folder. You can open the HTML report in a web browser to view
test results.
